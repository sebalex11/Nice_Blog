## Hello World

I have decided to start this blog after listening to a few guest off of the podcast [codenewbies](http://www.codenewbie.org/).

I think that it would be good for me to begin documenting my progress so that I can see where I've been and what I should eventually do next. This is also a good way for me to get some practice adding features to a site and how to utilize github cause I only know the basics at the moment. 


<sub>I may do music reviews here for now too.</sub>
